;; Is the table mutated by the host code? Call graph depends on this assumption.
;; If the table is not mutated:
;;   $main -> $imported (JavaScript) -> $export1
;; With the table mutation in main.js:
;;   $main -> $imported (JavaScript) -> $export2
;; In this particular program, the most precise call graph should include knowledge about the host code, so it is:
;;   $main -> $imported (JavaScript) -> $export2
;; The only functions that can be added into the table by the host, are the ones that are reachable from the host. So $not-reachable can never be reachable.
;; So the ground truth is:
;; Entry point: $main
;; Precise call graph:
;;   $main -> $imported (JavaScript) -> $export2
;; Reachable (actually executed) functions:
;;   $main, $export2
